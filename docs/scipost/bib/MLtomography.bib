	abstract = {A major bottleneck in the quest for scalable many-body quantum technologies is the difficulty in benchmarking their preparations, which suffer from an exponential `curse of dimensionality' inherent to their quantum states. We present an experimentally friendly method for density matrix reconstruction based on deep neural-network generative models. The learning procedure comes with a built-in approximate certificate of the reconstruction and makes no assumptions on the state under scrutiny, making it both reliable and unconditional. It can efficiently handle a broad class of complex systems including prototypical states in quantum information, as well as ground states of local spin models common to condensed matter physics. The key insight is to reduce the state tomography task to an unsupervised learning problem of the statistics of an informationally complete set of quantum measurements. This constitutes a modern machine learning approach to the validation of large quantum devices, which may prove relevant as a neural-network ansatz over mixed states suitable for variational optimization.},

	abstract = {Machine learning is actively being explored for its potential to design, validate, and even hybridize with near-term quantum devices. A central question is whether neural networks can provide a tractable representation of a given quantum state of interest. When true, stochastic neural networks can be employed for many unsupervised tasks, including generative modeling and state tomography. However, to be applicable for real experiments, such methods must be able to encode quantum mixed states. Here, we parametrize a density matrix based on a restricted Boltzmann machine that is capable of purifying a mixed state through auxiliary degrees of freedom embedded in the latent space of its hidden units. We implement the algorithm numerically and use it to perform tomography on some typical states of entangled photons, achieving fidelities competitive with standard techniques.},
